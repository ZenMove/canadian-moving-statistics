Canadian Moving Statistics is an open dataset providing cleaned, non-proprietary summaries of publicly available Statistics Canada data related to household mobility and moving in Canada.

The project focuses on high-level indicators such as the share of households that moved, reasons for moving, and migration patterns, making official government data easier to access, reference, and reuse for research, journalism, education, and public policy analysis.

All data is derived from authoritative government sources and includes source table references for transparency. This repository does not introduce original analysis, projections, or modeling.
